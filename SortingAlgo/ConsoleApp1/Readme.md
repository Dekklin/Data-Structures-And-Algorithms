# Description
Insert sort starts at the beginning of the array and begins determining whether the number after it is greater than or less than, This runs as many times as there are numbers. It starts with a nested forloop, one is used as a counter, the other is used as a reference to to compare in the array

# Uses
Insert sort seems quick and easy for small to medium sized arrays but once the array becomes very large I feel like this method isn't very fast, but it is consistent! the Big O will always be O of N squared
