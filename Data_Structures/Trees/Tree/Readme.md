The BinaryTree and the BinarySearchTree have multiple children, two to be exact. The SearchTree is organized numerically, therefore it would be best to use when you want data to be organized.
A Tree could be used to traverse through a large amount of numberical data. Perhaps keeping track of highscores, or it could be used as a random number selector.
