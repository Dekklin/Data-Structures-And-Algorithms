# Overview
  Data Structures are a design patter for data. They arent any new data, just a format for data. And the prototypes that are attached to it are changed depending on the data format.
# HashTables
  A HashTable is a format/design for a collection of Key Value Pairs. Each key value pair is hashed based off the key, and then stored in a large array so that it is very hard to locate. This allows you to keep large amounts of data with keeping a relatively low Big O on time

Hashtables are great for holding large amounts of information, so like a roster for a school/team. Or id codes attached to a group of people. You insert the name of a person and you get returned their special ID attached to their account.
