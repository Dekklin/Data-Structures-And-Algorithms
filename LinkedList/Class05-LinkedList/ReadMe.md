# Challenge: Linked List
This program is a simple test of how Linked Lists work and operate. It as methods to add linked lists, before and after nodes. Also in the front of the link list. It can locate a node and add a node. Linked Lists seem to be useful when you're needing to have a conglomerate of information that changes in size. Compared to arrays, you can add a node at the front of the LinkedList so the Big O for Time is much much faster than adding it to the end of an array without affecting the rest of the array.
